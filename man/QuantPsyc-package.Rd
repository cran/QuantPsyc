Quantitative Psychology Tools 
}

\description{
Contains tools useful in screening univariate and multivariate data, testing simple moderating relationships (Cohen et. al. 2003)<doi:10.4324/9780203774441>, extimating indirect effects based on simple (proximal) and complex (distal) mediating relationships(MacKinnon et. al. 2002)<doi:10.1037/1082-989x.7.1.83> . A tool for computing power in a given F distribution is also included (Murphy & Myors 2014)<ISBN:9781315773155>. These are basic operations covered in a multivariate course in most Doctoral level Psychology programs. THese functions will also likely be useful in other domains (e.g., sociology, business management, medicine).

These functions can be grouped into 4 sets.\cr
     Data Screening\cr
     Moderation\cr
     Mediation\cr
     Power Calculation\cr
\cr

\emph{Data Screening} tools include both graphical and statistical methods for assessing the shape of the distributions as well as look for any outliers. Key functions include \code{norm} and \code{mult.norm}. \emph{Moderation} functions are based on Aiken & West (1991) and Cohen, Cohen, West & Aiken (2003). Currently, only simple models are permissible (Y ~ X + Z + XZ). Key functions include \code{moderate.lm}, \code{sim.slopes}, and \code{graph.mod}. \emph{Mediation} functions are largely based on MacKinnon et al (2002) and Fletcher (2006). Both simple (one mediator) and complex (chain of two mediators) relationships can be estimated. Key functions include \code{proximal.med}, and \code{distal.med}. Finally, \code{powerF} will calculate power based on an F distribution given percent variance accounted for (e.g. effect size) and degrees of freedom (e.g., model parameters and sample size). Some of the functions are original and others borrowed from numerous sources. I have taken care to reference appropriately.
